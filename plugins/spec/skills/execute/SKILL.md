name: execute
description: Use when executing an implementation plan stored in the project's Obsidian vault in a fresh session, or when the user invokes /spec:execute. Subagent-driven with pinned models, per-task review gates, and escalation-only routing.

# spec:execute

Runs a vault plan task-by-task through pinned subagents. Self-contained — no superpowers skills required. This is the **fresh-session handoff** path; if you are still in the session that wrote the spec, prefer same-session execution (see `spec:plan` → execution modes).

## Project config (read this first)

Read the `spec` config — the fenced ```json under `## spec configuration`in`CLAUDE.local.md`. It provides `project`, `vault.name`, `vault.root`, `vault.subpath`. **If absent, STOP** and tell the user to run `/spec:setup`. `{subpath}`=`vault.subpath`.

## Workflow

1. **Load the plan from the vault.** Confirm the active vault first: `mcp__obsidian__vault_read` `{subpath}/_index.md`, check its `vault:` frontmatter equals `vault.name`; mismatch → **STOP** and ask the user to open the right vault. Then read the plan (`vault_get_document_map`, then `vault_read` by heading for large plans) and its linked spec's **Key facts** section. The plan's **Execution model policy** table is the routing source of truth. Agents are namespaced — use `spec:plan-executor`, `spec:plan-executor-light`, `spec:plan-executor-heavy`, `spec:plan-reviewer`; map bare or legacy names from older plans onto these.

2. **Track tasks.** Create one task-list item per plan task; mark in_progress/completed as you go.

3. **Dispatch loop — per task:**

   - Dispatch by **explicit** `subagent_type` from the policy table — never auto-select by description. The dispatch prompt must be self-contained: the task's full text, the plan's Conventions, and the relevant Key facts. Executors write the code themselves; do not write it for them and do not expect the plan to contain it.
   - **Review gate (authorship tasks only):** when the executor returns, dispatch `spec:plan-reviewer` on the task's diff. On **CHANGES-NEEDED**, re-dispatch the **same** executor with the ordered fix list, then review again. On **APPROVE**, move on. Light (no-authorship) tasks skip review.
   - **Escalation-only routing:** a task that failed, is stuck on a red test, or uncovered cross-file fallout gets re-dispatched to `spec:plan-executor-heavy` with the failure evidence attached. Never downgrade a task below its pin, and never "fix it quickly" in the orchestrator — that bypasses the review gate.

4. **Honour stop gates.** If the plan says "stop and ask" before a task, stop and ask.

5. **Verification policy.** Executors run **targeted tests only**. The full verification (build + lint + full suite) is the plan's **final task**, run once — do not insert extra full runs between tasks; they make execution take ages for no added signal.

6. **Keep the orchestrator lean.** Do not read changed files into this context — work from executor and reviewer reports. Relay a one-line progress note to the user after each task.

## Requires

The agents `spec:plan-executor`, `spec:plan-executor-light`, `spec:plan-executor-heavy`, `spec:plan-reviewer` (ship with this plugin) and the `obsidian` MCP.
